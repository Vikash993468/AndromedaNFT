# AndromedaNFT

## Project Description

**AndromedaNFT** is a blockchain-based platform designed to create, trade, and collect unique Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) representing digital assets related to the world of automobiles. Through AndromedaNFT, car enthusiasts, collectors, and investors can mint, buy, and sell digital collectibles that showcase rare and iconic cars in a decentralized and secure environment. 

Each car in AndromedaNFT is a one-of-a-kind digital collectible, verified on the blockchain, ensuring the ownership and authenticity of the assets. The platform combines automotive passion with the cutting-edge technology of NFTs, creating a unique space where digital and physical worlds collide.

## Project Vision

The vision behind **AndromedaNFT** is to create a digital ecosystem that bridges the automotive industry with the world of NFTs. We aim to bring together car culture and blockchain technology, giving users a platform to engage with automotive-themed digital assets in a secure, transparent, and decentralized manner. 

Our long-term goal is to become the leading platform for car-based NFTs, preserving automotive history in the digital realm, and creating a community where car enthusiasts, artists, and collectors can interact and thrive.

## Key Features

- **NFT Minting**: Users can mint unique, blockchain-backed NFTs representing classic, rare, or custom vehicles, providing secure ownership and scarcity.
- **Car Marketplace**: A marketplace to buy, sell, and trade car NFTs, giving collectors and enthusiasts access to a vast array of digital automotive assets.

=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
